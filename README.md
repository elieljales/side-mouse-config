# side-mouse-config
====

#History
I created this little python script to use the side button of my mouse on Ubuntu 

#How to Use
First you must install:
- pyautogui
- pyautogui

After install those libraries, open the .py file and edit the shortcut you want in sidebutton( I wanted minimize window when I press, so I put Win + H )

Finally you run the .py file:
python side_button_config.py


#Test
Test with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS running Python 3.8/Python 2.7
